By using neural networks with **multiple layers**, deep learning models have the ability to recognize and understand complex patterns in various types of data, including images, text, sounds, and more. This enables deep learning models to provide accurate insights and make predictions based on the learned patterns. \n",

    "Since the dataset from the previous step contains `6118` features, it was important to utilize a certain number of **most important features** to reduce the computational cost downstream. This was achieved using feature ranking with **recursive feature elimination (`RFE`)**.\n",

    "Using an external estimator (`RandomForestClassifier`), the least significant features are iteratively eliminated. It starts by training an estimator on the full feature set and ranks the features based on their importance. Then, it removes the least important feature(s) and repeats the process until a desired number of features (`n_features_to_select`) is reached. This mitigates over-fitting and improves generalization by focusing on the most informative features."
